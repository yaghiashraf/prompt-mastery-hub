**Title:** I built a free tool to generate "DEPTH" prompts (security, performance, logic) for coding tasks. No more "lazy" ChatGPT code.

**Body:**

Hey r/PromptEngineering,

Like many of you, I got tired of ChatGPT giving me "tutorial-level" code that ignores edge cases, security, and performance. I realized the issue wasn't the model (GPT-4/Claude 3.5 are capable), but the context I was providing.

I spent the last few weeks researching frameworks like **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and the **DEPTH Framework** (Define, Establish, Provide, Task, Human) to force reliability.

I built a free tool to automate this structure so I don't have to type it out every time.

**The Tool:** [PromptHub](https://prompt-mastery-hub.netlify.app/)
**The Logic:** [See the Diff (Basic vs. DEPTH)](https://prompt-mastery-hub.netlify.app/blog/depth-vs-basic.html)

### How it works (The Engine)
It's a client-side generator (no API keys required) that uses a deterministic template engine.

1.  **You Input:** "Senior Python Dev", "Write a file downloader".
2.  **It Analyzes:** Detects "Dev" role -> Assigns "Security Auditor" & "Performance Specialist" to the panel.
3.  **It Generates:** A markdown prompt that forces the LLM to:
    *   Simulate a debate between the experts.
    *   Define success metrics (e.g., "Must handle 10GB files", "Must verify SSL").
    *   Critique its own draft before outputting code.

### The Result
Instead of:
> *"Here is `requests.get(url).content`"* (which crashes RAM on large files)

You get:
> *"Here is a streaming implementation with `shutil.copyfileobj`, timeout handling, and SSL verification."*

### Features
*   **Smart Persona Assignment:** Dynamic expert panels based on your role input.
*   **CoT Scratchpad:** Forces "thinking" steps before the final answer.
*   **Developer Showcase:** [See CI/CD integration examples](https://prompt-mastery-hub.netlify.app/showcase.html)

It's free to use the generator. I added a "Pro" tier for some advanced recursive templates, but the core engine is open.

Would love feedback on the generated prompt structures. Does the "Expert Panel" simulation improve your outputs as much as it did mine?
